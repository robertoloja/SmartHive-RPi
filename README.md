## Setup Instructions

1. Setup a MongoDB instance with the default configuration.
2. Start the MongoDB instance.
3. Install Node.JS and npm.
4. Change directory into this project's directory (where the package.json file
   is), and run the command 'npm install'.
5. Run 'node server.js'.

This should fire up the HTTP server and open a browser window. Login to google,
from that window, which will create the hive entry in MongoDB and Firebase.
